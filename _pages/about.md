My name is Zijian Zhang, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at the University of Michigan, with an expected graduation in May 2026. Originally from Guangzhou, China, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Economics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). My academic journey has been marked by a strong foundation in Mathematics and Economics coursework, all of which reflect my passion for solving complex problems and understanding the world through data-driven insights.

Currently, my interests are evolving toward the Financial Market, Biotech and Human Resources analytics, driven by my passion for data-driven decision-making. as I enjoy exploring how mathematical and statistical models can be applied to predict trends and optimize strategies.
