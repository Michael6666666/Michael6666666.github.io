My name is Zijian Zhang, and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at the University of Michigan, with an expected graduation in May 2026. Originally from Guangzhou, China, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Economics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). My academic journey has been marked by a strong foundation in Mathematics and Economics coursework, all of which reflect my passion for solving complex problems and understanding the world through data-driven insights.

Throughout my education, I have honed my expertise in mathematical modeling, programming, and data analysis, with proficiency in Python, MATLAB, and LaTeX. My technical toolkit also includes advanced knowledge of tools like Microsoft Excel for data analysis and visualization. Beyond my technical skills, I have cultivated a unique ability to communicate intricate concepts effectively, a skill I demonstrated through multiple mentorship roles. As a tutor and mentor for Physics I and Calculus I at RPI, I assisted freshmen in overcoming challenging material, improving exam scores, and building their confidence in problem-solving.

My professional experience spans both academic and industry settings. During my tenure as an intern at AIA International Wealth in Guangzhou, I collaborated with a team to analyze insurance products and market strategies, earning first place in a competitive presentation. This experience not only deepened my understanding of financial products but also strengthened my project management and communication skills. My interest in the financial market has grown from these experiences, as I enjoy exploring how mathematical and statistical models can be applied to predict trends and optimize strategies.

In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have worked on impactful projects that merge theoretical knowledge with real-world applications. At the University of Michigan, I investigated the role of additional currents in the Morris-Lecar model to understand tonic-clonic seizure transitions, simulating network dynamics to propose potential therapeutic solutions. My interdisciplinary curiosity also extends to network science, where I applied Kalmanâ€™s Rank Condition to study the controllability and firing patterns of neural networks.

Currently, my interests are evolving toward the financial market and human resources (HR) analytics, driven by my passion for data-driven decision-making. I believe my ability to bridge mathematical rigor with practical applications positions me uniquely to tackle challenges in these fields. Whether it's analyzing market trends, optimizing portfolio strategies, or enhancing HR systems through predictive modeling, I am eager to contribute my analytical skills to meaningful projects.

Above all, I am a dedicated learner who thrives in collaborative environments. My achievements, such as winning second place in the Math Integration Bee and excelling as a mentor, reflect my commitment to excellence and continuous improvement. I look forward to opportunities where I can leverage my skills and interests to make a tangible impact.
